I'm a 25 year olds man. My roommate always says that mostly when we are watching TV in the afternoon. He noticed that I usually fall asleep even while we are talking. it's a bit embarrassing. I think I am not a person like that. I feel something is wrong. So I decided to meet a doctor to check about this. So the doctor asked me to do the sleep test which is called Multiple Sleep Latency Test. This test just requires me to take a bunch of short naps during the daytime. and the doctor monitored my sleep. It is so surprising that the test also confirms that I quickly fall asleep and enter REM sleep. The doctor said this could be narcolepsy, which is a sleep disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness. I'm waiting to do an overnight sleep study and see a sleep specialist to figure out what the next steps are.
