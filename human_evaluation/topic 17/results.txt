I am a 67 year old woman. I went to the ophthalmologist because I was not seeing well from both of my eyes especially during the night. The physical exam showed that my pupils are normal in diameter both in the light and darkness, however the acuity test results confirmed that I have a blurry vision of 50/100 that is probably linked to cataract. I will need to consult a second ophthalmologist to confirm the diagnosis and I might need to do further lab tests.
