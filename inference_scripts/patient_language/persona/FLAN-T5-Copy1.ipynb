I only use over-the-counter multivitamins to keep myself fresh and energized. My mom had a hip fracture. The doctor took my blood pressure and it was 130/80 and my pulse was 112/min. I have annoying back pain from time to time and to be honest I don't exercise much or move much. My BMI is 24. I did a spine X-ray a while ago and my doctor showed me that I have a fracture on one of my vertebrae. I also have a low bone density in my lumbar vertebrae and T-score values below -2.5.

I also had appendicitis. I'm currently seeing several men and, to be honest, some of them do struggle to wear a condom. I went to the hospital to check myself up and they told me that my vitals were normal. I also had a blood test on Monday, and my β-hCG level was 1800 mIU/mL, and then on Wednesday, it went up to 2100 mIU/mL.

I'm 27, I don't take medication, nor I don't have any other illnesses. My vitals were normal. My doc told me there were pink spots on the back of my throat. I'm heterosexual and have been only with my boyfriend and he uses condoms. I smoke 1 or 2 cigarettes a day and I drink a beer to accompany it. I had a biopsy and it showed some thick and grainy skin texture. The doc said it's an immune reaction.? OPTIONS:\n",

My pain was even more intense with back flexion, and when I raised my legs, it radiated into my left leg. The doctor did an anus exam where he had to pinch it and it was not reacting!

However my X-Rays show some liquid on the left side and a mass where the liquid got hard. The scary thing is that the liquid was bloody when they got it out. They did a biopsy and it showed that I have an increase of epithelioid-type cells with very long microvilli.? OPTIONS:\n",

      " I went to my doctor's office because of a non-stop heartburn and some acid reflux. I took over-the-counter medications, but it keeps going strong! I don't smoke, take drugs or drink alcohol, I'm healthy! The doctor took my vitals, which turned out normal. My BMI is 31, which might be a bit too much for a 48-year-old guy like me. They examined my stomach and found a mild tenderness in the upper part. I also did some X-rays, and they found out that I have an air-fluid opacity behind my heart. I did another X-ray, and it turns out that a part of my stomach went up my chest through a hole in my diaphragm!? OPTIONS:\n",

I should admit that I've been smoking 2 packs of cigarettes every day for the past 30 years. My doctor told me that my breath in my left lung sounds bad. But he told me that my blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate and temperature are normal. My belly is also normal. However my X-Rays show some liquid on the left side and a mass where the liquid got hard. The scary thing is that the liquid was bloody when they got it out.

      " I went to my doctor's office because of a non-stop heartburn and some acid reflux. I took over-the-counter medications, but it keeps going strong! I don't smoke, take drugs or drink alcohol, I'm healthy! The doctor took my vitals, which turned out normal. My BMI is 31, which might be a bit too much for a 48-year-old guy like me. They examined my stomach and found a mild tenderness in the upper part. I also did some X-rays, and they found out that I have an air-fluid opacity behind my heart. I did another X-ray, and it turns out that a part of my stomach went up my chest through a hole in my diaphragm!? OPTIONS:\n",

I feel like a stiffness that last less than 15 minutes. The pain is moderately severe but it gets worse when I'm using my hands. I used Tylenol which helped a little. Apart from that, I suffer from hypertension and high cholesterol. The doctor made me notice that I have bumps around both of my hand joints. I also suffer from my knees and they are also stiff in the morning for around 30 min. It's even worse when I climb up the stairs!

I also had a blood test on Monday, and my β-hCG level was 1800 mIU/mL, and then on Wednesday, it went up to 2100 mIU/mL.

      " I am 61 and I had to go to the clinic because I couldn't stop coughing and I experienced some breath shortness. I suffer from hypertension and cholesterol and I also have a stomach ulcer. I should admit that I've been smoking 2 packs of cigarettes every day for the past 30 years. My doctor told me that my breath in my left lung sounds bad. But he told me that my blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate and temperature are normal. My belly is also normal. However my X-Rays show some liquid on the left side and a mass where the liquid got hard. The scary thing is that the liquid was bloody when they got it out.

My BMI is 23 and my vitals were normal. The doctor performed a physical exam and found that my uterus was tender and enlarged. She proposed me a hysterectomy and diagnosed me with adenomyosis.?

The lovely doctor performed a physical exam and she told me that she has short limbs and a larger head. My girl also has a flat nasal bridge and a small midface. My baby just has the face of her father, unlike me! They performed some genetic testing on my child and my husband and found out that both my husband and her have a mutation of the FGFR3 gene, which led the doctor to diagnose them with dwarfism.

The doctor did an exam which highlighted weakness in the leg muscles and unusually large calf muscles. The rest of the exam was fine, and his vitals were normal. My son did a muscle biopsy, and it showed that the protein important for muscle strength and function is missing. The doctor diagnosed him with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.? OPTIONS:\n",

I did a barium swallow test, which is an X-ray of my throat, which revealed a problem in the upper part of my esophagus, where there's a small pouch or bulge at the spot where my throat meets the esophagus.?

I feel like a stiffness that last less than 15 minutes. The pain is moderately severe but it gets worse when I'm using my hands. I used Tylenol which helped a little. Apart from that, I suffer from hypertension and high cholesterol. The doctor made me notice that I have bumps around both of my hand joints. I also suffer from my knees and they are also stiff in the morning for around 30 min. It's even worse when I climb up the stairs! I also feel like my bones are rubbing against each other when I'm moving. The X-ray showed that I have narrow joint space, I have sclerosis, and abnormal growths of bone along my joints.?

The doctor told me that it was swollen right next to my ligament. It's even bigger when I'm coughing. I'm suffering from high cholesterol and I already had to adapt my lifestyle to keep the disease under control. I do not smoke but to be honest I still drink from time to time. The doctor found my vitals normal. She gave me a note to see a surgeon to get my mass removed and get a hernia repair.? OPTIONS:\n",

But he told me that my blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate and temperature are normal. My belly is also normal. However my X-Rays show some liquid on the left side and a mass where the liquid got hard. The scary thing is that the liquid was bloody when they got it out.

      " I went to my doctor's office because of a non-stop heartburn and some acid reflux. I took over-the-counter medications, but it keeps going strong! I don't smoke, take drugs or drink alcohol, I'm healthy! The doctor took my vitals, which turned out normal. My BMI is 31, which might be a bit too much for a 48-year-old guy like me. They examined my stomach and found a mild tenderness in the upper part. I also did some X-rays, and they found out that I have an air-fluid opacity behind my heart. I did another X-ray, and it turns out that a part of my stomach went up my chest through a hole in my diaphragm!? OPTIONS:\n",

      " I just brought my little 3-year-old girl to the clinic to have her checked up by the doctor. I was worried sick because she was smaller than her classmates. The lovely doctor performed a physical exam and she told me that she has short limbs and a larger head. My girl also has a flat nasal bridge and a small midface. My baby just has the face of her father, unlike me! They performed some genetic testing on my child and my husband and found out that both my husband and her have a mutation of the FGFR3 gene, which led the doctor to diagnose them with dwarfism. My baby never received any treatment and it was our first visit to the doctor since we arrived in the US. The other tests regarding her mental and physical development were perfectly fine.?

I even ask my wife to help me out with my daily routine. I used to be the one paying the bills, but now she has to give me a hand. My wife mentioned to the doctor that I used to be independent and that I tend to forget where we live. I suffer from hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. My poor dad was suffering from Alzheimer disease, so I hope I'm not going to end the same way! I did an MRI and they found out that some part of my brain was decreasing. I also did an Alzheimer test.? OPTIONS:\n",

      " I brought my  8-year-old son to the doctor's clinic. He was struggling to stand up from a chair for the past few days. My wife is healthy but she was pretty worried since his brother died in his 20s after being disabled and using a wheelchair for the last years of his life. The doctor did an exam which highlighted weakness in the leg muscles and unusually large calf muscles. The rest of the exam was fine, and his vitals were normal. My son did a muscle biopsy, and it showed that the protein important for muscle strength and function is missing. The doctor diagnosed him with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.? OPTIONS:\n",

      " I just turned 32 and last morning I woke up with strange blood stains on my underwear. My last periods were more than 2 months ago, which is unusual for me because I used to have regular periods lasting for 6 days every 29 days, more or less. I had several UTIs in the past. I also had appendicitis. I'm currently seeing several men and, to be honest, some of them do struggle to wear a condom. I went to the hospital to check myself up and they told me that my vitals were normal. I also had a blood test on Monday, and my β-hCG level was 1800 mIU/mL, and then on Wednesday, it went up to 2100 mIU/mL. The gynecologist also did an ultrasound and she told me that, hopefully, there was no ovule.? OPTIONS:\n",

      " I had to rush to the ER because of a non-stop nosebleed that had been on for 1 hour. As a 23-year-old, I always had heavy periods, and sometimes, my gums would bleed after going to the dentist or brushing my teeth. I thought that it was not very alarming since my mom also had heavy periods. I did some lab tests that showed that I had increased bleeding time and long clotting time. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy, and I don't smoke or take any kind of drugs. I drink only at parties from time to time. I have been with my boyfriend for the last 2 years.

I was still standing on my feet, not febrile and I don't remember hitting my head or anything. I don't have any special medical history, but I had been diagnosed with gout before. I take Lopurin to prevent my gouty attacks. My dad had the same problem, but my 41-year-old brother is healthy and does not have gouty attacks. The doctor did a physical exam and found that the joints between my toes and the rest of my foot were swollen and tender. The doctor renewed his diagnosis of gouty arthritis.? OPTIONS:\n",

Apart from that, I suffer from hypertension and high cholesterol. The doctor made me notice that I have bumps around both of my hand joints. I also suffer from my knees and they are also stiff in the morning for around 30 min. It's even worse when I climb up the stairs! I also feel like my bones are rubbing against each other when I'm moving. The X-ray showed that I have narrow joint space, I have sclerosis, and abnormal growths of bone along my joints.?

The doctor did an exam which highlighted weakness in the leg muscles and unusually large calf muscles. The rest of the exam was fine, and his vitals were normal. My son did a muscle biopsy, and it showed that the protein important for muscle strength and function is missing. The doctor diagnosed him with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.? OPTIONS:\n",

      " I'm just a 39-year-old young woman but lately I have noticed some underlying cysts on my legs and my joints were hurting so much. I don't have a fever. I don't have rashes. My medical history is totally clean and I don't take any medication. When I went to the clinic they did a physical examination where they found that my liver is enlarged. They also found that the lesions on my legs are kind of tender and they are located on the front side of my legs. I do not smoke and I drink alcohol occasionally. I have to male sexual partners. On the day of my visit my vitals were fine. I did an X-ray of my chest and I had swollen lymph nodes. I also has a blood test and it came back with a high ACE level. I also had a biopsy of my skin lesions that came back negative for fungi and AFB.? OPTIONS:\n",

      " I'm 17, and I had to go to the doctor because I've been suffering from my right elbow for several months. The pain is even worse when I do sports and it kind of limits me for my workouts and activities. I tried over-the-counter medications but it didn't work much. I had eczema before and my medication is ointments that contain cortisone. I am sexually active as a 17-year-old guy, and I have a girlfriend, and we use condoms. I don't smoke or drink. I play tennis most days of the week. I did an exam that showed pain on the side of my elbow and it was worse when they applied some pressure on it and when I was putting my hand as a fist.

      " I'm a 30-year-old computer scientist. I did some lab tests that came back quite alarming, stating that I have azoospermia?! I'm sexually active with my wife and we don't use contraception. We've been trying to have a child for the past year. I have a medical history of pneumonia and shortness of breath and regular wet cough. I had several lung infections when I was a kid. That's why I'm very careful and don't smoke, do drugs, or drink. I don't have other medical conditions including allergies or any kind of surgery. The doctor did the clubbing test on my fingers, which was positive. I also did an ultrasound and it showed that I'm missing the tubes that carry sperm around. I also had a 75% for my respiratory function test.? OPTIONS:\n",

My dad died suddenly when he was 35, so I'm kind of scared. My vitals were normal while at the ER and they did a physical exam and they told me my heart sounds abnormal. My lungs are ok, but I had to do an echography of my heart, and they told me it is bigger than average.? OPTIONS:\n",

      " I'm a 66-year-old woman and I went to my doctor's office because of a bloody joint pain in my hands that has been lasting for a while. The pain comes and go in the morning usually. I feel like a stiffness that last less than 15 minutes. The pain is moderately severe but it gets worse when I'm using my hands. I used Tylenol which helped a little. Apart from that, I suffer from hypertension and high cholesterol. The doctor made me notice that I have bumps around both of my hand joints. I also suffer from my knees and they are also stiff in the morning for around 30 min. It's even worse when I climb up the stairs! I also feel like my bones are rubbing against each other when I'm moving. The X-ray showed that I have narrow joint space, I have sclerosis, and abnormal growths of bone along my joints.?

I had to go to the dermatology clinic because I had terrible redness on my face, especially on my forehead and cheeks. It got worse in the summer and after being under the sun. I'm usually healthy. They conducted a physical exam and they found several lesions and pustules on my forehead, cheeks and nose and they also found some signs of erythema and telangiectasia.

I feel like a stiffness that last less than 15 minutes. The pain is moderately severe but it gets worse when I'm using my hands. I used Tylenol which helped a little. Apart from that, I suffer from hypertension and high cholesterol. The doctor made me notice that I have bumps around both of my hand joints. I also suffer from my knees and they are also stiff in the morning for around 30 min. It's even worse when I climb up the stairs!

But he told me that my blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate and temperature are normal. My belly is also normal. However my X-Rays show some liquid on the left side and a mass where the liquid got hard. The scary thing is that the liquid was bloody when they got it out.

They found out that I have weaknesses in both of my arms and legs. I also did a blood test on an empty stomach, and I had a glucose level of 138 mg/dL, and twice the upper normal limit of cortisol.

I don't smoke, but I drink alcohol from time to time. To be honest, I've been drinking a little more lately since it helps me with the shaking. My mom had the same issue when she was my age. The doctor took my vitals, and they were normal. I don't have any other medical issues. I underwent neurological exams and it showed that I’m shaky from both sides.

I also suffer from my knees and they are also stiff in the morning for around 30 min. It's even worse when I climb up the stairs!

I feel like a stiffness that last less than 15 minutes. The pain is moderately severe but it gets worse when I'm using my hands. I used Tylenol which helped a little. Apart from that, I suffer from hypertension and high cholesterol. The doctor made me notice that I have bumps around both of my hand joints. I also suffer from my knees and they are also stiff in the morning for around 30 min. It's even worse when I climb up the stairs! I also feel like my bones are rubbing against each other when I'm moving. The X-ray showed that I have narrow joint space, I have sclerosis, and abnormal growths of bone along my joints.?

I don't smoke, take drugs or drink alcohol, I'm healthy! The doctor took my vitals, which turned out normal. My BMI is 31, which might be a bit too much for a 48-year-old guy like me. They examined my stomach and found a mild tenderness in the upper part. I also did some X-rays, and they found out that I have an air-fluid opacity behind my heart.

For the past few months I’ve felt really tired and noticed my hips ache a lot. I have a history of mild cholesterol issues but I’ve been managing that with my diet and lifestyle. When the doctors checked me my blood pressure and pulse were normal and my vision and neurological exams didn’t show anything wrong.

I also had appendicitis. I'm currently seeing several men and, to be honest, some of them do struggle to wear a condom. I went to the hospital to check myself up and they told me that my vitals were normal. I also had a blood test on Monday, and my β-hCG level was 1800 mIU/mL, and then on Wednesday, it went up to 2100 mIU/mL.

      " I'm a 30-year-old computer scientist. I did some lab tests that came back quite alarming, stating that I have azoospermia?! I'm sexually active with my wife and we don't use contraception. We've been trying to have a child for the past year. I have a medical history of pneumonia and shortness of breath and regular wet cough. I had several lung infections when I was a kid. That's why I'm very careful and don't smoke, do drugs, or drink. I don't have other medical conditions including allergies or any kind of surgery. The doctor did the clubbing test on my fingers, which was positive. I also did an ultrasound and it showed that I'm missing the tubes that carry sperm around. I also had a 75% for my respiratory function test.? OPTIONS:\n",

Apart from that, I suffer from hypertension and high cholesterol. The doctor made me notice that I have bumps around both of my hand joints. I also suffer from my knees and they are also stiff in the morning for around 30 min. It's even worse when I climb up the stairs! I also feel like my bones are rubbing against each other when I'm moving. The X-ray showed that I have narrow joint space, I have sclerosis, and abnormal growths of bone along my joints.?

      " I just turned 32 and last morning I woke up with strange blood stains on my underwear. My last periods were more than 2 months ago, which is unusual for me because I used to have regular periods lasting for 6 days every 29 days, more or less. I had several UTIs in the past. I also had appendicitis. I'm currently seeing several men and, to be honest, some of them do struggle to wear a condom. I went to the hospital to check myself up and they told me that my vitals were normal. I also had a blood test on Monday, and my β-hCG level was 1800 mIU/mL, and then on Wednesday, it went up to 2100 mIU/mL. The gynecologist also did an ultrasound and she told me that, hopefully, there was no ovule.? OPTIONS:\n",

      " I'm a 67-year-old lady, and I went to the clinic due to nonstop choking, difficulty swallowing, and coughing. I also suffer from hypertension, cholesterol, and osteoarthritis. I do not smoke or drink alcohol. I live with my husband, and we are independent retired elementary school teachers. During the exam, my blood pressure was 135/80 mm Hg. The doctor told me I had a smelly breath. How embarrassing! The rest of my physical exam was normal. I did a barium swallow test, which is an X-ray of my throat, which revealed a problem in the upper part of my esophagus, where there's a small pouch or bulge at the spot where my throat meets the esophagus.?

      " I am a 70-year-old man, and I paid a visit to the doctor with my wife the other day. I noticed that I tend to forget small things and that my memory has decreased over the past few years. I even ask my wife to help me out with my daily routine. I used to be the one paying the bills, but now she has to give me a hand. My wife mentioned to the doctor that I used to be independent and that I tend to forget where we live. I suffer from hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. My poor dad was suffering from Alzheimer disease, so I hope I'm not going to end the same way! I did an MRI and they found out that some part of my brain was decreasing. I also did an Alzheimer test.? OPTIONS:\n",

When I was admitted, my vitals were normal. My BMI is 37. When they looked into my ears, they said that my left tympanic membrane was broken and there was some fluid behind the membrane. During the hearing test, they could assess that my left ear suffers from hearing loss. They also performed ear, nose, and throat examinations that turned out to be normal.? OPTIONS:\n",

      " I just brought my little 3-year-old girl to the clinic to have her checked up by the doctor. I was worried sick because she was smaller than her classmates. The lovely doctor performed a physical exam and she told me that she has short limbs and a larger head. My girl also has a flat nasal bridge and a small midface. My baby just has the face of her father, unlike me! They performed some genetic testing on my child and my husband and found out that both my husband and her have a mutation of the FGFR3 gene, which led the doctor to diagnose them with dwarfism. My baby never received any treatment and it was our first visit to the doctor since we arrived in the US. The other tests regarding her mental and physical development were perfectly fine.?
